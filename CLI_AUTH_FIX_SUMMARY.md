# CLI Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
CLI agent operations were blocked by the authentication layer:
- CLI commands were not properly authenticating with the API server
- No mechanism for handling authentication tokens in CLI environment
- API requests were missing proper authorization headers
- System commands had syntax errors preventing proper execution

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added CLI Authentication Infrastructure
- Created `src/cli/auth.py` module for CLI-specific authentication handling
- Added functions for managing CLI user authentication state
- Implemented anonymous user fallback for CLI operations
- Added support for environment-based authentication tokens

### 2. Enhanced CLI Utilities
- Updated `src/cli/utils.py` to include `os` import
- Added `get_api_headers()` function that includes authentication when available
- Implemented environment variable support for `HIVE_CLI_TOKEN`
- Added proper Authorization header handling

### 3. Updated All CLI Commands
- Modified all API calls in `src/cli/commands/agent.py` to use authentication headers
- Updated all API calls in `src/cli/commands/task.py` to use authentication headers
- Fixed syntax error in `src/cli/commands/system.py`
- Ensured all CLI commands can make authenticated requests when tokens are provided

### 4. Authentication Flow
1. CLI checks for `HIVE_CLI_TOKEN` environment variable
2. If token found, adds `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header to API requests
3. If no token, uses anonymous CLI user access (existing behavior)
4. All API requests now include proper authentication headers

## Results
- ✅ CLI commands can now authenticate with API server when tokens are provided
- ✅ Anonymous access still works for development/local usage
- ✅ Environment-based authentication token support
- ✅ All CLI commands updated to use proper authentication headers
- ✅ Fixed syntax errors in system commands
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Testing
Verified the fix with comprehensive tests:
- CLI authentication module loads correctly
- API headers include authentication when tokens are provided
- All CLI command modules import successfully
- Authorization headers are properly added to requests
- All tests pass successfully

This fix resolves the "CLI Power User Gap" by enabling proper authentication for CLI agent operations, unblocking system usability via standard interfaces.
