# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
Agents were becoming unresponsive due to authentication issues:
- Hardcoded database connection details in `agent:runner.py` didn't match actual Docker configuration
- Database URL used port 5432 instead of 5433 (Docker mapping)
- Database credentials were hardcoded instead of using environment configuration
- Redis connection used port 6379 instead of 6381 (Docker mapping)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Environment Configuration (`.env`)
- Fixed `DATABASE_URL` to use correct port 5433 and credentials
- Verified `REDIS_URL` uses correct port 6381

### 2. Enhanced `agent:runner.py` Authentication
- Added proper configuration loading using the existing settings system
- Implemented robust URL parsing for both database and Redis connections
- Added error handling and reconnection logic for database/Redis connections
- Added graceful degradation when configuration imports fail

### 3. Improved Connection Handling
- Database connection now uses `postgresql://hive_user:hive_pass@localhost:5433/leanvibe_hive`
- Redis connection now uses `redis://localhost:6381`
- Added retry logic for connection failures
- Added cleanup handling for connection resources

## Results
- ✅ Agents can now authenticate and connect to database properly
- ✅ Agents can now connect to Redis without port conflicts
- ✅ Agent spawning and registration works correctly
- ✅ No more authentication-related unresponsive agent issues
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging for connection issues

## Testing
Verified the fix with comprehensive tests:
- Configuration loading and validation
- Database connection with proper credentials
- Redis connection with proper port mapping
- Agent spawning, registration, and termination
- All tests pass successfully

This fix resolves the "Unresponsive agents: test-auth-agent" issue by ensuring agents can properly authenticate with the database and Redis services using the correct connection details.
