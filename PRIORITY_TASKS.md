## NEW PHASE 6 PRIORITIES (Active Development)

### 1. Implement Context Engine API Integration  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Type**: integration  
**Assigned to**: architect-agent  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

Complete missing API endpoints for context search and document addition. Bridge CLI commands to working backend functionality.

### 2. Implement Parallel Multi-Agent Task Processing
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Type**: coordination  
**Assigned to**: meta-agent  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

Enable true concurrent agent execution with load balancing and real-time coordination protocols.

### 3. Spawn Missing Specialized Agents
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Type**: system  
**Assigned to**: devops-agent  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

Deploy architect-agent and qa-agent to complete 4-agent ensemble for specialized task handling.

- **API Response Time**: <100ms p95 (âœ… currently achieved)
- **Agent Task Completion Rate**: >85% (âœ… 100% recent success rate)
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Enable 4 agents working in parallel
- **Context Retrieval Accuracy**: >90% (pending API integration)
- **Self-Modification Success Rate**: >85% (âœ… infrastructure ready)
- **Agent Spawning**: 4 specialized agents (meta, devops, architect, qa)

## Implementation Timeline

**Current Week**: Core system stabilization and agent expansion
- Context engine API completion
- Multi-agent coordination protocols
- Agent spawning and load balancing

**Next 2 Weeks**: Advanced intelligence features  
- Performance monitoring stack
- Autonomous learning capabilities
- Advanced workflow orchestration

## Multi-Agent Coordination Status

**âœ… Implemented Coordination Types:**
- Sequential execution (working)
- Task decomposition (available)
- Agent capability mapping (functional)
- Collaboration protocols (6 types ready)

**ðŸ”„ In Progress:**
- Parallel execution (agents available but need coordination)
- Real-time load balancing
- Conflict resolution during concurrent tasks

**ðŸ“‹ Next Steps:**
- Deploy full 4-agent ensemble
- Enable true parallel processing
- Implement advanced monitoring
