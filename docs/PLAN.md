## DECISION LOG

### Key Architectural Decisions:
1. **Leverage Existing ADW Infrastructure**: Build on implemented session_manager, reconnaissance, micro_development components
2. **Safety-First Approach**: Prioritize resource monitoring and rollback before extended sessions
3. **Incremental Validation**: Test 4-hour → 8-hour → 16-hour → 24-hour sessions progressively
4. **Proactive Monitoring**: Implement predictive failure prevention vs reactive fixes

### Technology Choices:
- **Resource Monitoring**: psutil for system metrics, custom algorithms for AI-specific patterns
- **Rollback System**: Git-based with database backup integration
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics with Redis backing, web-based dashboard
- **Failure Prediction**: ML-based pattern analysis with rule-based fallbacks

**GOAL**: Complete final integration issues and emergency protocols to achieve >95% system validation and full production readiness for 24-hour autonomous development sessions.
