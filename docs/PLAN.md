## RISK MITIGATION (Updated)

### Current High-Risk Areas:
1. **Resource Exhaustion**: No current monitoring - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
2. **Extended Session Degradation**: No cognitive load management
3. **Lack of Predictive Failure Prevention**: Reactive vs proactive approach
4. **Limited Long-Session Testing**: Need 16+ hour validation

### Mitigation Strategy:
- **Week 1**: Implement resource guardian and enhanced rollback
- **Week 2**: Add cognitive load management and monitoring  
- **Week 3**: Comprehensive extended session testing

---

## DECISION LOG

### Key Architectural Decisions:
1. **Leverage Existing ADW Infrastructure**: Build on implemented session_manager, reconnaissance, micro_development components
2. **Safety-First Approach**: Prioritize resource monitoring and rollback before extended sessions
3. **Incremental Validation**: Test 4-hour → 8-hour → 16-hour → 24-hour sessions progressively
4. **Proactive Monitoring**: Implement predictive failure prevention vs reactive fixes

### Technology Choices:
- **Resource Monitoring**: psutil for system metrics, custom algorithms for AI-specific patterns
- **Rollback System**: Git-based with database backup integration
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics with Redis backing, web-based dashboard
- **Failure Prediction**: ML-based pattern analysis with rule-based fallbacks

---

**GOAL**: Complete missing safety and optimization components to achieve 24-hour autonomous development sessions with <1% failure rate by end of Week 3.
