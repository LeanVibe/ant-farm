# Deprecation Candidates

The following files appear redundant or superseded. Review and confirm removal.

- TECHNICAL_DEBT.md — superseded by TECHNICAL_DEBT_CONSOLIDATED.md
- ENHANCED_COMMUNICATION_SUMMARY.md — content overlaps with docs/communication-prd.md
- SYSTEM_EVALUATION_REPORT.md — consolidate key metrics into SYSTEM_READINESS_ASSESSMENT.md
- CURRENT_SYSTEM_STATUS.md — overlaps with README.md current status section
- echo_task_summary.md — historical artifact; integrate into reports or remove

Action:
- If you approve, I will delete these and merge any remaining useful bits into the core docs.
