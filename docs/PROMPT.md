### Important Context & Lessons Learned

**Recent CI Pipeline Issues & Solutions**:
- **Problem**: CI runs were hanging indefinitely (30+ minutes)
- **Root Causes**: Hardcoded local DB credentials, long test sleeps, missing timeouts
- **Solutions Applied**: Updated test config, reduced sleep times, added CI timeouts
- **Lesson**: Always use environment-appropriate configuration in tests

**Current System Health**:
- **Infrastructure**: Fully operational with Docker health checks
- **Services**: Non-standard ports prevent local service conflicts
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with real service integration
- **CI/CD**: Stable pipeline with proper timeout protection

   - Begin PWA dashboard development

3. **Production Readiness Push**:
   - Security hardening and vulnerability assessment
   - Performance optimization and load testing
   - Deployment automation and rollback procedures
   - Monitoring, alerting, and operational dashboards

**Long-term Vision Alignment**:
- Self-improving autonomous system that can modify its own code
- 24/7 operation with minimal human intervention
- Scalable multi-agent architecture for complex tasks
- Comprehensive testing and safety mechanisms
- Production-ready deployment and monitoring
