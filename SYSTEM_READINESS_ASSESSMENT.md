- Self-modification engine improvements
- Advanced monitoring and observability
- Production readiness features

**Priority 4: Technical Debt Resolution (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- Extract hardcoded sleep intervals to configuration
- Implement proper system lifecycle management
- Replace synchronous operations in async contexts
- Optimize database session management

### ðŸš€ DEVELOPMENT READINESS STATUS: READY FOR FEATURE DEVELOPMENT

Current system meets readiness criteria:

1. **âœ… Core System Stability**: All integration tests passing
2. **âœ… Infrastructure Health**: All services operational and monitored
3. **âœ… CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment working
4. **âœ… Documentation**: Up-to-date and comprehensive

### ðŸ“‹ RECOMMENDED NEXT FEATURES (Ready for Implementation)

**Phase 1: System Enhancement** 
- Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Advanced logging and observability features
